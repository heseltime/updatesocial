# Welcome, Accessability Buddies!

This is the repo for our work as part of [Update Social](https://updatesocial.org/)

## Organisational

### Links

We'll want to connect important links to resources we consult regularly.

### Original Project Plan

From the community call:

### Current Project Plan

Changes are usually likely. Updates to the plan will follow here.

### Documents-Management

Let's keep this repo as the main source of truth! Code goes into /prototype, all other directories are docs.

### Editing-Privileges

The same for all group members.

### Blog

We might like to run a blog from this repo to publish elsewhere, but we'll discuss that soon.

## The Work

Now it gets interesting.
