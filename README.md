We might like to run a blog from this repo to publish elsewhere, but we'll discuss that soon.

## The Work

### Language

It might be helpful to collect German (DE) and English (EN) language references for currently appropriate and helpful words to use when talkbing about disability, accessibility and also documents, i.e. the technology relating to making documents accessible. **Does someone want to take this?**
