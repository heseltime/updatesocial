**Let's keep up the dialog and the society-art-tech thinking!** I want to also take this note to revamp this rX Feed and steer it in an LLM research project direction, namely an accessible documents project building on in-context (vs finetuned) LLM application to solve some real world problems that can make people's lives better.
